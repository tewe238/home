# FOSSGIS: Course preparation assignment

Work through the following tasks before the next seminar on **Wed 27.10.2021.** 

If you have **questions or problems, post them in the _Technical problems_ channel in Microsoft Teams.**

## 1. Apply for a Microsoft Teams account

Apply for a Microsoft Teams account at [URZ](https://it-service.uni-heidelberg.de/anfrage/teams_benutzer_freischalten). Once you get your account, I will add you to the FOSSGIS course.

## 2. Create a GitHub account

Create a GitHub account on [github.com](https://github.com/), if you don't have one already. Send your GitHub name to [christina.ludwig@uni-heidelberg.de](christina.ludwig@uni-heidelberg.de).

## 3. Install required software

If you are on Windows, follow these instructions. If you are on a different operating system, post it in the _Technical problems_ channel in Microsoft Teams or send an email to [christina.ludwig@uni-heidelberg.de](mailto:christina.ludwig@uni-heidelberg.de).

### Windows 

#### Install GIS software

1. Download the OSGeo4W Installer [here](https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/)
2. Run the installer and select "Advanced Installation" (Fortgeschrittene Installation). Click through the steps and keep the default values.

	**Section: Desktop**

	* grass: GRASS GIS version (7.8.6-1)
	* qgis-ltr: QGIS Desktop (3.16) [LTR stands for Long Term Release and is usually more stable]

	**Section: Libs**

	* qgis-grass-plugin7: GRASS7 plugin for QGIS (3.20.3-1)

**Note:** Additional packages will be selected automatically which are needed to run the ones listed above. So just keep those as well.

### Mac OS

1. Download and install the following software [QGIS 3.16](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html#).

3. Open the terminal and execute the command "gdalinfo". If you get the message "command not found" post it in the _Technical problems_ channel in MS Teams. 

----

### Linux

The QGIS Installation instructions are given in the [QGIS documentation](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#linux). Make sure to install both **QGIS 3.16** (qgis) and the **QGIS GRASS plugin** (qgis-plugin-grass)

```
sudo apt install qgis qgis-plugin-grass
```

**Note:** I am not sure if GRASS GIS is installed as well. If it is not available within the QGIS toolbox, install GRASS GIS 7.8 from [https://grass.osgeo.org/download/linux/](https://grass.osgeo.org/download/linux/).

##### 

When you install gdal

```
sudo apt install gdal-python
```


## 4. Learn how to use the command line

Watch the following command line tutorial videos:
